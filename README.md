## Introduction

 The African Marketplace App is intended to empower small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. My team and have built an app that enables business owners to create listings for items they have for sale. 

 In this particular repo, you will find the backend portion of the application.

 Hosted on [Heroku](https://africanmarket.herokuapp.com/), the RESTful API was built with technologies such as Node.js, Express, and knex.
